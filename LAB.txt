To solve these process scheduling algorithm problems, let's walk through the steps required for drawing Gantt charts and computing finish time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each algorithm. We'll use an example dataset:
Example Dataset (Processes with Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority)
Process	Arrival Time	Burst Time	Priority
P1	0	5	2
P2	1	3	1
P3	2	8	3
P4	3	6	4
________________________________________
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Gantt Chart
Order: Based on Arrival Time (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4).
Time	Process
0-5	P1
5-8	P2
8-16	P3
16-22	P4
Computations
Completion Time (CT): Time when process finishes execution.
Turnaround Time (TAT): TAT = CT - Arrival Time
Waiting Time (WT): WT = TAT - Burst Time
Process	Arrival Time	Burst Time	Completion Time	Turnaround Time	Waiting Time
P1	0	5	5	5	0
P2	1	3	8	7	4
P3	2	8	16	14	6
P4	3	6	22	19	13
________________________________________
2. Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-Preemptive
Gantt Chart
Order: Based on Burst Time after a process has arrived (P1 → P2 → P4 → P3).
Time	Process
0-5	P1
5-8	P2
8-14	P4
14-22	P3

P4	3	6	14	11	5
________________________________________
3. Round Robin (RR)

•	Time Quantum = 4
Gantt Chart
Order: Processes are executed in a cyclic manner with a time quantum of 4 until all are complete.

P2	1	3	17	16	13
P3	2	8	20	18	10
P4	3	6	22	19	13
________________________________________
4. Priority Scheduling - Non-Preemptive
Gantt Chart
Order: Based on Priority (lower number = higher priority).
Priority Order: P2 → P1 → P3 → P4.
Time	Process
0-3	P2
3-8	P1
8-16	P3
16-22	P4
Computations

P2	1	3	3	2	0
P3	2	8	16	14	6
P4	3	6	22	19	13
________________________________________
Summary of Algorithms
1.	FCFS: Simple, based on arrival time.
2.	SJF: Shortest burst time first, reduces average waiting time.
3.	Round Robin: Fair, good for time-sharing systems.
4.	Priority Scheduling: Prioritizes tasks based on importance.
These computations can be applied to any dataset by substituting the arrival times, burst times, and priorities as needed! Let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown for any specific algorithm.

Here are programs to implement FIFO and LRU Page Replacement Algorithms in C.
________________________________________
1. FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm
The First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm replaces the oldest page in memory first.
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

void fifoPageReplacement(int pages[], int n, int capacity) {
    int frame[capacity], front = 0, count = 0, pageFaults = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
        frame[i] = -1; // Initialize frame with empty slots
    }

    printf("Page Frames Status:\n");

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int found = 0;

        // Check if page is already in the frame
        for (int j = 0; j < capacity; j++) {
            if (frame[j] == pages[i]) {
                found = 1;
                break;
            }
        }

        // If page not found, replace the oldest page
        if (!found) {
            frame[front] = pages[i];
            front = (front + 1) % capacity;
            pageFaults++;
        }

        // Print current frame status
        for (int j = 0; j < capacity; j++) {
            if (frame[j] == -1)
                printf(" - ");
            else
                printf(" %d ", frame[j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    printf("Total Page Faults: %d\n", pageFaults);
}

int main() {
    int n, capacity;

    printf("Enter number of pages: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int pages[n];
    printf("Enter the pages:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &pages[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter frame capacity: ");
    scanf("%d", &capacity);

    fifoPageReplacement(pages, n, capacity);

    return 0;
}
________________________________________
2. LRU Page Replacement Algorithm
The Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

void lruPageReplacement(int pages[], int n, int capacity) {
    int frame[capacity], lastUsed[capacity];
    int pageFaults = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
        frame[i] = -1;        // Initialize frame with empty slots
        lastUsed[i] = INT_MAX; // Initialize usage time
    }

    printf("Page Frames Status:\n");

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int found = 0;

        // Check if the page is already in the frame
        for (int j = 0; j < capacity; j++) {
            if (frame[j] == pages[i]) {
                found = 1;
                lastUsed[j] = i; // Update last used time
                break;
            }
        }

        // If page not found, replace the least recently used page
        if (!found) {
            int lruIndex = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < capacity; j++) {
                if (lastUsed[j] < lastUsed[lruIndex]) {
                    lruIndex = j;
                }
            }
            frame[lruIndex] = pages[i];
            lastUsed[lruIndex] = i;
            pageFaults++;
        }

        // Print current frame status
        for (int j = 0; j < capacity; j++) {
            if (frame[j] == -1)
                printf(" - ");
            else
                printf(" %d ", frame[j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    printf("Total Page Faults: %d\n", pageFaults);
}

int main() {
    int n, capacity;

    printf("Enter number of pages: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int pages[n];
    printf("Enter the pages:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &pages[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter frame capacity: ");
    scanf("%d", &capacity);

    lruPageReplacement(pages, n, capacity);

    return 0;
}

int main() {
    char memory[MEMORY_SIZE][INSTRUCTION_SIZE]; // Memory array
    int instructionCounter = 0;
    char opcode[3];
    int operand;
    ErrorType error = NONE;

    // Preloaded program in memory (with errors)
    strcpy(memory[0], "GD10");
    strcpy(memory[1], "XY15"); // Invalid opcode

    int pageNumber = virtualAddress / PAGE_SIZE;
    int offset = virtualAddress % PAGE_SIZE;

    if (pageNumber >= pageTableSize) {
        printf("Error: Invalid virtual address (Page %d does not exist).\n", pageNumber);
        return -1;
    }

    int realAddress = pageTable[pageNumber] * PAGE_SIZE + offset;
    return realAddress;

int main() {
    int virtualAddress;

    printf("Enter Virtual Address (e.g., VA=12): ");
    scanf("%d", &virtualAddress);

    int realAddress = virtualToRealAddress(virtualAddress);
